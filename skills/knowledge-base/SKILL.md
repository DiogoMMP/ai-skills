# Knowledge Base scaffolding

Sets up a personal knowledge base wiki, in one of two modes:

- **research** — Andrej Karpathy's
  ["LLM Knowledge Bases"](https://gist.github.com/karpathy/442a6bf555914893e9891c11519de94f)
  setup: heterogeneous external sources land in `raw/`, an LLM incrementally compiles them into
  `wiki/`. Good when there's a real body of external material to ingest (papers, articles,
  datasets, repos).
- **code** — lighter setup for a personal code repo: no `raw/`. The wiki is built directly from
  your own scratch notes (`notes/`) and the repo's git history via the `compile-wiki` skill.
  Good when you *are* the source material and just want decisions/context to survive past your
  own memory, without team-knowledge-sharing overhead you don't need.

In both modes, `wiki/` is meant to be edited by the LLM, not by hand — Obsidian (or any markdown
viewer) is just the frontend for viewing it.

## Steps

1. **Ask which mode.** Ask the user: research-style KB (raw/ + wiki/) or code-repo KB (wiki/ +
   notes/, no raw/)? Don't guess — the two produce different structures and `KB_GUIDE.md`
   content.

2. **Ask where to create it.** Ask which directory the knowledge base should be created in.
   Offer sensible options: the current directory, or a new subdirectory (ask for its name —
   suggest one derived from the topic if the user has mentioned one). Always confirm the target
   path before creating anything.

3. **Ask for a topic/title** if it isn't already obvious from the conversation (e.g. "AI safety
   research", "this repo's name"). Used as the title in `wiki/index.md` and `KB_GUIDE.md`. A
   generic placeholder is fine if the user has no topic yet.

4. **Research mode only: ask how `raw/` will hold source material.** Don't guess — it changes
   whether `raw/` ends up as a real folder, a link, or both:

   - **Guardado diretamente** — files get copied/dropped into `raw/` as-is, versioned in this
     repo, exactly like Karpathy's original design.
   - **Link para uma pasta existente** — the material already lives elsewhere (a synced Drive
     folder, another repo, a folder you keep organizing outside git) and `raw/` should point at
     it instead of duplicating it. Ask for that folder's path.
   - **Os dois** — `raw/` is a real folder for anything added directly, plus one or more named
     subfolders that are links to existing external folders. Ask for each external folder's path
     and a short name to link it under (e.g. `raw/faculdade` → `D:\Faculdade\MEIA`).

   Skip this step entirely in code mode — there's no `raw/` there.

5. **Create the structure** under the target directory, branching on mode:

   **research mode:**

   ```
   <target>/
   ├── raw/
   │   └── README.md
   ├── wiki/
   │   ├── README.md
   │   └── index.md
   ├── outputs/
   │   └── README.md
   ├── tools/
   │   └── README.md
   └── KB_GUIDE.md
   ```

   - `raw/`, depending on the answer to step 4:
     - *Guardado diretamente*: create it as a real folder and copy `templates/raw-README.md` →
       `<target>/raw/README.md`, exactly as before.
     - *Link*: create `raw/` itself as a directory link to the given external folder — skip
       copying `raw-README.md`, there's nothing to explain inside a folder this KB doesn't own.
       - **Windows**: `New-Item -ItemType Junction -Path "<target>\raw" -Target "<external>"`
         (PowerShell), or `cmd /c mklink /J "<target>\raw" "<external>"` (via Bash).
       - **macOS/Linux**: `ln -s "<external>" "<target>/raw"`.
       Create a `.gitignore` in `<target>` containing `/raw/` — this is the one case where a
       `.gitignore` is created without being asked, because linked content must never be
       duplicated into this repo's git history.
     - *Os dois*: create `raw/` as a real folder with `templates/raw-README.md` copied in, then
       for each external folder from step 4 create a named link inside it the same way (e.g.
       `raw/<name>` → `<external>`), and add a `/raw/<name>/` line to `.gitignore` for each one
       created.
     Either way, once `raw/` involves a link, append a short note to `KB_GUIDE.md` (after
     copying it below) recording the external path(s) and that they're git-ignored — mirroring
     the note added for `wiki/_geral` in step 7.
   - Copy `templates/wiki-README.md` → `<target>/wiki/README.md`
   - Copy `templates/wiki-index.md` → `<target>/wiki/index.md`, replacing `{{TOPIC}}` and
     `{{DATE}}`
   - Copy `templates/outputs-README.md` → `<target>/outputs/README.md`
   - Copy `templates/tools-README.md` → `<target>/tools/README.md`
   - Copy `templates/KB_GUIDE.md` → `<target>/KB_GUIDE.md`, replacing `{{TOPIC}}` and `{{DATE}}`
     (this template's frontmatter sets `mode: research`)

   **code mode:**

   ```
   <target>/
   ├── wiki/
   │   ├── README.md
   │   └── index.md
   ├── notes/
   │   └── README.md
   └── KB_GUIDE.md
   ```

   - Copy `templates/code-wiki-README.md` → `<target>/wiki/README.md`
   - Copy `templates/code-wiki-index.md` → `<target>/wiki/index.md`, replacing `{{TOPIC}}` and
     `{{DATE}}`
   - Copy `templates/notes-README.md` → `<target>/notes/README.md`
   - Copy `templates/code-KB_GUIDE.md` → `<target>/KB_GUIDE.md`, replacing `{{TOPIC}}` and
     `{{DATE}}` (this template's frontmatter sets `mode: code` and leaves `last_compiled_at`
     and `domain_model` empty — `compile-wiki` fills in the former on its first run)

   Either way: if the target directory is inside a git repo, do not create a `.gitignore` unless
   asked — just leave the `README.md` files as the thing that keeps otherwise-empty folders
   tracked. The one exception is a linked `raw/` (step 4, *Link* or *Os dois*): that `.gitignore`
   is created regardless, per step 5 above.

6. **Code mode only: ask about a domain model.** Ask the user whether the project has a domain
   model worth documenting (e.g. DDD entities, an ORM schema, an ER diagram, a class diagram).
   If yes, ask where it lives — a path to the entity/model files or folder, or a diagram file —
   or a short description if there's nothing to point at yet. Record whatever they give you in
   `KB_GUIDE.md`'s `domain_model` frontmatter field (a path, list of paths, or free text; leave
   it empty if they say no). This only needs asking once — `compile-wiki` reads it on every run
   to keep the structure overview current. Skip this step entirely in research mode.

7. **Ask about linking to a general/shared vault.** Ask the user whether this KB should link
   into a general/shared Obsidian vault, so both show up in the same graph. If they decline or
   don't have one, skip to step 8.

   If they want a link:
   - Ask for the path to the general vault.
   - If nothing exists at that path yet, offer to bootstrap it first by running steps 1–5 of
     this same skill against that path (topic: something like "Geral" or whatever the user calls
     it — research or code mode, whichever fits how they'll use it). Confirm with the user
     before creating it.
   - Verify the general vault has a `wiki/` directory, then create a directory link named
     `_geral` inside the project's `wiki/`, pointing at the general vault's `wiki/`:
     - **Windows**: `cmd /c mklink /J "<target>\wiki\_geral" "<general-vault>\wiki"` (via Bash),
       or `New-Item -ItemType Junction -Path "<target>\wiki\_geral" -Target "<general-vault>\wiki"`
       (via PowerShell). Junctions don't need Developer Mode or admin rights, unlike symlinks.
     - **macOS/Linux**: `ln -s "<general-vault>/wiki" "<target>/wiki/_geral"`.
   - Confirm the link resolves (list `<target>/wiki/_geral` and check it shows the general
     vault's contents) before reporting success.
   - Append a short note to the project's `KB_GUIDE.md` recording that `wiki/_geral/` is a
     linked, read-only reference into the general vault — content there is maintained by the
     general vault's own compile step, never written to from this project.

8. **Report back**: show the resulting tree, briefly explain each folder for the mode chosen,
   and point at `KB_GUIDE.md` for the full workflow. If a general-vault link was created,
   mention it too. In code mode, mention that the first `compile-wiki` run will generate
   `wiki/Estrutura.md`, a structure overview kept fresh on every run.

## Notes

- Never write directly into `wiki/` as "the answer" to a one-off question. In research mode
  that's what `outputs/` is for; only promote content into `wiki/` when it's meant to durably
  enhance the knowledge base. Code mode has no `outputs/` — there's no one-off Q&A rendering
  step, so this mostly doesn't come up.
- Keep source material read-only in spirit: `raw/` (research mode) is never edited by the LLM;
  `notes/` (code mode) has its frontmatter status updated by `compile-wiki` but its written
  content is never rewritten.
- When `raw/` (or a subfolder of it) is a link rather than a real folder, that's doubly true:
  never write into it, not even a `README.md` — it's someone else's folder, this KB just reads
  through it.
- `wiki/_geral/` (when linked) is likewise read-only from this project's point of view: it's a
  directory link, not a copy, so edits made there would actually land in the general vault.
