name: create-pr
description: "Open a pull request for the current branch, following a GitFlow-style branching strategy for personal projects. It does NOT commit and does NOT push — the branch must already be committed and pushed (use `commit-push` for that). It reads the repository's pull request template FIRST, fills that exact template in from the real diff — in Portuguese by default — links every `docs/changes/` feature / bugfix / hotfix / fix record the branch touches, appends the `🤖 Generated with [Claude Code]` line at the end, shows the complete title and body, and waits for explicit validation before running `gh pr create`. Use whenever the user wants a PR opened or its body written — e.g. 'abre o PR', 'faz o pull request', 'cria PR para develop', 'open a PR', 'write the PR description', 'PR body'."

# Create Pull Request — GitFlow

**Scope — read this first.** This skill opens a pull request. That is all it does.

- It **never** stages, **never** commits, **never** amends, **never** pushes, **never** merges.
- It assumes the work is already committed **and** already pushed to `origin`.
- If it isn't, this skill **stops and says so** — the user runs `commit-push` first. Do not "help"
  by committing or pushing on the way; that is another skill's job and another skill's gate.

**One hard gate:** show the *fully filled-in* title and body, wait for the user's explicit OK, only
then run `gh pr create`. Opening the PR in the same turn as the proposal is a failure of this skill,
even if the user said "abre o PR" up front — that authorizes the *flow*, not the body they have not
seen yet.

**Two rules that hold everywhere in this skill:**

- **Language — Portuguese by default.** Every word you write into the PR body goes in Portuguese,
  whatever the language of the chat, of the commits, or of the code — unless the template found in
  Step 3 is itself fixed prose in another language, in which case follow the template's language
  instead. No mixed-language bodies, no English summary under Portuguese headings. See Step 4.
- **Always link the `docs/changes/` records.** Any feature / bugfix / hotfix / fix Markdown record
  this branch adds or touches must be linked from the PR body. See Step 4.

---

## Step 1 — Read the state, and refuse if the branch isn't ready

Run these in one batch (read-only, cheap):

```bash
git status --porcelain=v1 --branch
git branch --show-current
git remote -v
gh pr view --json url,state,title 2>/dev/null   # is there already a PR for this branch?
```

Then check the three preconditions. **Any of them failing stops the skill** — report it plainly and
name the fix, don't perform the fix:

| Situation | What to do |
| --- | --- |
| Uncommitted changes in the working tree | Stop. List them and say they need committing first (`commit-push`). Ask whether to proceed with the PR **without** them only if the user brings it up. |
| Branch has no upstream, or `[ahead N]` unpushed commits | Stop. Say the branch must be pushed first (`commit-push`, or `git push -u origin <branch>`). |
| Detached HEAD, or on `main` / `develop` | Stop. There is no PR to open from an integration branch — GitFlow expects the PR to come *from* an auxiliary branch. |
| A PR already exists for this branch | Report its URL and state instead of creating a second one. Offer to update its body only if the user asks (see Step 5). |

With the preconditions met, read what the PR actually contains — always against the base branch
resolved in Step 2, never against the working tree:

```bash
git log --oneline origin/<base>..HEAD
git diff --stat origin/<base>...HEAD
git diff origin/<base>...HEAD
```

Also read the repo's `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` if present. **Repo-level conventions win over the
defaults in this skill** (required PR sections, title pattern, base-branch policy).

The PR body must describe **the whole branch**, not just the last commit. Read every commit in that
range.

---

## Step 2 — Resolve the base branch from GitFlow

| Head branch | Base (PR target) |
| --- | --- |
| `feature/<slug>` | `develop` |
| `bugfix/<slug>` | the `release/*` it branched from |
| `release/<version>` | `main` |
| `hotfix/<slug>` | `main` |

- Confirm the resolved base in the gate at Step 5 — **never guess it silently**.
- For a `bugfix/*`, find the parent release branch (`git branch -r --contains` on the merge base, or
  ask) instead of defaulting to `develop`.
- If the branch's slug leads with a number (`feature/12-dark-mode`), treat `12` as a GitHub issue and
  link it. This is a convenience, not a requirement — most personal-project branches carry no issue
  number, and that's fine; never ask the user to supply one just to fill this in.

---

## Step 3 — READ THE PR TEMPLATE FIRST (mandatory, before writing any body text)

**Never write a PR body out of your own head.** Before drafting a single line, find the repository's
pull request template and read it in full. Look, in this order, and take the first that exists:

```bash
ls .github/pull_request_template.md \
   .github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md \
   .github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/*.md \
   docs/pull_request_template.md \
   .gitlab/merge_request_templates/*.md \
   PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md 2>/dev/null
```

If several exist under `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/`, pick the one matching the change type
(feature / bugfix / hotfix) and say in chat which you picked.

Then `cat` it and treat its content as the **skeleton you must fill in**:

- **Keep the template's structure byte-for-byte** — same headings, same order, same emoji, same
  horizontal rules, same blockquotes, same language, whatever that language is; **do not translate it**
  and do not re-word its fixed text.
- **Do not drop sections** you consider irrelevant. Fill them with the honest answer — `N/A`, or a
  one-line reason — instead of deleting them.
- **Do not add sections** the template doesn't have. If the repo's `CLAUDE.md` demands extra ones
  (e.g. **Summary**, **Changes**, **Tests**), place them **inside** the template's description section
  rather than replacing the template with them.
- **Replace the HTML-comment placeholders** (`<!-- Explica o que foi feito ... -->`) with real
  content drawn from the diff; don't leave the comments in the submitted body.
- **Tick a change-type box** (`- [x] Feature 🚀`) according to the branch prefix and what the diff
  actually does.
- **Tick a checklist box only for something you actually verified in this session** — a build you
  ran, tests you saw pass, a manual check you performed. Leave the rest unticked; never tick a box
  just to make the PR look complete. Say in chat which ones you left unticked and why, so the user
  can tick them after checking.
- **Hotfix sync checklist:** when the template has one and the PR is a `hotfix/*` or targets `main`,
  it is mandatory — fill it honestly rather than skipping it.
- **If no template exists**, fall back to the sections the repo's `CLAUDE.md` requires (**Summary**,
  **Changes**, **Tests**), and state in chat that no template was found.

---

## Step 4 — Compose the title and body

**Title** — Conventional Commits shape: `fix(auth): reject forged logout navigations`. When a related
GitHub issue exists (derived from the branch slug, e.g. `feature/12-dark-mode`, or given by the
user), reference it — in the title (`(#12)`) or, failing that, in the body. This is optional: don't
block on it, and never ask the user to open an issue just to have something to reference. If the
template's own checklist names a title pattern (e.g. `[tipo]: descrição curta`), follow **that**
pattern instead. Imperative mood, no trailing period, ≤ 72 chars.

**Body language — Portuguese by default.** Write every word you add in Portuguese (pt-PT), regardless
of the language of the chat, of the commit messages, or of the code — that's the default for this
user's personal projects. **Exception:** if the template you found in Step 3 is itself clearly written
in another language (fixed headings and prose, not just placeholders), follow the template's own
language instead so the body doesn't mix languages with its fixed text. Never produce a mixed-language
body (an English *Summary* under `## 📋 Descrição` is wrong).

**Technical vocabulary stays in English** — the rule governs the prose, not the jargon. Keep as-is:

- code identifiers, class / method / property names, file paths, branch names, issue numbers, commands;
- product, tool, framework and service names actually used in the repo (whatever they are);
- established IT terms with no natural pt-PT equivalent, or whose translation would obscure the
  meaning for the reviewer — *endpoint*, *middleware*, *build*, *deploy*, *merge*, *rollback*,
  *cache*, *token*, *commit*, *branch*, *pull request*, *timeout*, *seed*, *job*, *log*;
- the `🤖 Generated with [Claude Code]` line.

Everything around them — the sentences, the verbs, the connective tissue, the checklist answers — is
Portuguese. Write `Corrigido o endpoint de logout para rejeitar navegações forjadas`, never
`Fixed the logout endpoint…` and never a laboured `ponto de extremidade`.

If the user explicitly asks for a PR body in another language for a given PR, that request wins for
that PR — the Portuguese default doesn't override an explicit instruction.

**Body content** — describe intent, not a file listing. Say *why* the change exists, what a reviewer
should look at, and anything non-obvious (trade-offs, follow-ups deliberately left out, migration or
deploy steps). Never claim a test ran that you did not run.

### Link the `docs/changes/` records — always

This project records work as Markdown under `docs/changes/` (kept separate from any `docs/wiki/` or
`docs/notes/` personal knowledge base the project might also have — see `implement-change`). Every
such record the branch **adds or modifies** must be linked from the PR body, so a reviewer reaches the
reasoning in one click:

| Folder | Record shape |
| --- | --- |
| `docs/changes/features/FNNNN-<slug>/` | folder — link its `README.md` (or the folder itself) |
| `docs/changes/bugfixes/BNNNN-<slug>/` | folder — link its `README.md` (or the folder itself) |
| `docs/changes/hotfixes/HNNNN-<slug>/` | folder — link its `README.md` (or the folder itself) |
| `docs/changes/fixes/<YYYY-MM-DD>--<Module>--<slug>.md` | single file — link the file |

Find them from the diff, never from memory:

```bash
git diff --name-only origin/<base>...HEAD -- docs/changes/
gh repo view --json nameWithOwner -q .nameWithOwner
```

Link form — **absolute `blob` URLs on the head branch**, because relative links do **not** resolve
inside a PR body (GitHub only resolves them inside files rendered from the repo):

```
- [F0004 — Dark mode toggle](https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/blob/feature/12-dark-mode/docs/changes/features/F0004-dark-mode-toggle/README.md)
- [Fix — duplicate crypto package pin](https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/blob/feature/12-dark-mode/docs/changes/fixes/2026-08-26--CrossCutting--duplicate-crypto-package-pin.md)
```

Rules:

- **Where:** the template's additional-information section (`## 📎 Informações adicionais` here), or
  wherever the repo's own template puts supplementary links. If the template has no such section, put
  the list at the end of the description section — never invent a new heading for it (Step 3).
- **Link text in the body's language**, and descriptive: the record id plus what it is, not a bare
  filename.
- **Only records that exist.** Link exactly what the diff shows; never guess an id, a slug or a date
  in a filename. Verify each path resolves on disk before writing the link (SC-7 never-invent).
- **When the branch touches no `docs/changes/` record**, say so in that section in the body's language
  (e.g. `Sem registos em \`docs/changes/\` associados a este PR.`) — never leave it blank, never
  fabricate a link to make it look complete. If the change is a defect fix and there is *no*
  `docs/changes/fixes/` entry, mention it in chat: the repo's convention expects one.
- Add the linked GitHub issue too when one is known or derivable; that's the minimum, not a
  requirement to go find one.

**Last line** — after everything the template produced, separated by a blank line:

```
🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)
```

Rules for that line — non-negotiable:

- **Exactly one** per PR body. Never duplicate it, never strip it.
- It goes at the **very end**, after the whole template.
- Verbatim, including the emoji and the markdown link. No variations, no extra wording.
- If you are editing an existing PR body that already has it, keep the one that is there rather than
  appending a second.

---

## Step 5 — PR GATE: show the filled body, wait, then open it

Print in chat, verbatim:

- the **base ← head** branches,
- the **title**,
- the **complete body** in one fenced block, exactly as it will be submitted (filled template + the
  Generated line),
- the commits the PR will carry (`git log --oneline origin/<base>..HEAD`).

Then ask for validation with `AskUserQuestion` ("Abro o PR assim?" → **"Sim, abre o PR"** /
**"Não, quero alterar"**) and **end the turn**. Do not run `gh pr create` in this turn.

Accept edits: if the user changes the title, the body, the base or a checkbox, re-show the revised
proposal and wait again.

On approval, open it with a heredoc so the markdown survives intact:

```bash
gh pr create --base develop --head feature/12-dark-mode \
  --title 'fix(auth): reject forged logout navigations (#12)' \
  --body-file - <<'PRBODY'
...filled template...

🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)
PRBODY
```

- Never `--fill` (it bypasses the template) and never `--draft` unless the user asks.
- Do not add reviewers, labels, milestones or assignees unless the user asks or `CODEOWNERS` /
  repo convention applies them automatically.
- **Never merge the PR**, and never approve it. Opening it is where this skill stops, even if the
  user said "e faz merge" — merging is a separate, explicitly-requested action.
- **Updating an existing PR** (only when asked): same flow — template first, show the full new body,
  gate, then `gh pr edit --body-file -`. Never overwrite a body a human has edited without showing
  the replacement first.
- If `gh` is missing or not authenticated, stop and report; hand the user the title and body so they
  can paste them into the web UI.

---

## Step 6 — Report

Short and factual:

- The PR URL, its title, and `base ← head`.
- The commits it carries.
- Which template checkboxes you left unticked, and why — so the user can complete them.
- Which `docs/changes/` records you linked, or that the branch touched none.
- Anything you flagged in Step 1 (uncommitted changes left behind, existing PR).
