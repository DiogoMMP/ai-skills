name: implement-change
description: "Implement a change — a feature, a bugfix, or a hotfix — end to end, in any project and any stack, and leave the written record the team expects. Accepts the request in ANY form — free text, an issue key or URL, a wiki page, a spec document, screenshots, a paste of a conversation, a mix — normalises it into evidence, determines the change type, then runs a fixed sequence: investigate → propose the plan in chat and WAIT for approval → write `docs/changes/<type>/<PREFIX><NNNN>-<slug>/README.md` (the spec, before any code) → implement → run the project's own verification gate → write `RESULT.md` (what actually happened, deviations included) → update that type's index → report. Both documents live in the same folder. It does NOT commit, push or open a PR — `commit-push` and `create-pr` do that. Use whenever the user wants a feature, bugfix or hotfix implemented, an issue implemented, or work planned-and-done with its record — e.g. 'implementa esta feature', 'corrige este bug com registo', 'faz este hotfix', 'implementa o ABC-123', 'implement this ticket', 'build this', 'quero acrescentar X'."

# Implement Change — plan, build, record

This skill produces **three things, in this order**, and the order is the point:

1. `docs/changes/<type>/<PREFIX><NNNN>-<slug>/README.md` — the **spec**, written and approved
   **before any code**.
2. The **implementation**.
3. `docs/changes/<type>/<PREFIX><NNNN>-<slug>/RESULT.md` — what **actually** happened, including the
   deviations.

Both documents live in the **same folder**. The same process — plan gate, README before code, RESULT
after — applies identically to all three change types below. Urgency is not a reason to skip the
record; a hotfix done at 2am is exactly when a written "what and why" matters most.

| Type | Prefix | Record folder | Typical branch | Base |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Feature | `F` | `docs/changes/features/` | `feature/<slug>` | `develop` |
| Bugfix | `B` | `docs/changes/bugfixes/` | `bugfix/<slug>` | the `release/*` it targets |
| Hotfix | `H` | `docs/changes/hotfixes/` | `hotfix/<slug>` | `main` |

Each type keeps its **own independent numbering** (`F0001`, `F0002`, … / `B0001`, `B0002`, … /
`H0001`, `H0002`, …) and its own index file, so the three families never collide.

**Why `docs/changes/` and not `docs/` directly:** a project's `docs/` folder may also host a personal
knowledge-base vault (`wiki/`, `notes/`, `.obsidian/` — see the `knowledge-base` skill). Nesting all
per-change records under `docs/changes/` keeps them out of that vault's file tree and graph instead of
mixing per-PR paperwork into synthesized, always-current knowledge. If a project's `docs/` has no such
vault, `docs/changes/` is still the right place — consistency across projects beats a shorter path in
the ones without a KB.

**Stack-agnostic by design.** This file describes the *process*. Every technical rule — layering,
naming, migrations, test layout, commit style — comes from **the project you are in**, discovered in
Phase 0.5. Never apply a convention from another project, and never assume a language or framework:
read the repo.

**Out of scope, deliberately:** this skill never commits, never pushes, never opens a PR, never
merges. Hand that to `commit-push` and then `create-pr` when the work is done.

**Language of the records:** match the language of the records already in that type's folder
(`docs/changes/<type>/`). If there are none, match the language of the repo's other docs; failing
that, the language the user is writing in. Technical vocabulary stays in English either way — code
identifiers, paths, branch names, issue keys, commands, product and tool names, and established IT
terms with no natural local equivalent (*endpoint*, *middleware*, *build*, *deploy*, *cache*, *token*,
*job*, *log*). Code and code comments follow the repo's own convention.

---

## Phase 0 — Input collection: accept anything, normalise it

The request may arrive in any shape. Take it as given and convert it into something a reviewer can
check. Handle each source with the right tool:

| Input shape | How to read it |
| :--- | :--- |
| Free-text description | Use as-is; it is the primary statement of intent. |
| JIRA / Linear / GitHub issue key or URL | Load the matching MCP or CLI tool (`ToolSearch` for Atlassian MCP, `gh issue view` for GitHub) and fetch the issue — summary, description, acceptance criteria, comments, linked items, attachments. |
| Confluence / Notion / wiki URL | Same route — fetch the page and read it in full, not just the title. |
| Any other URL | `WebFetch`. |
| Local file (spec, `.md`, PDF, export) | `Read` it. |
| Screenshot / image / Figma frame | `Read` it (or the Figma tooling) and describe in the record what it shows. |
| A pasted conversation or set of notes | Extract the requirement; separate what was **decided** from what was merely **discussed**. |

Then state, in chat, the request **as you understood it** — one short paragraph plus the acceptance
criteria you extracted — and name the source of each. This is cheap, and it catches a
misunderstanding before a day of work rather than after.

**Determine the change type — feature, bugfix, or hotfix.** Infer it from the evidence rather than
asking by default:

- Already on a branch matching the repo's `feature/*` / `bugfix/*` / `hotfix/*` pattern → that branch's
  type wins.
- The request describes new capability or behaviour that didn't exist before → **feature**.
- The request describes broken existing behaviour, found in a release candidate or in `develop`
  before it ships → **bugfix**.
- The request is an urgent fix for something already broken **in production** (`main`) → **hotfix**.

If the evidence genuinely doesn't settle it (e.g. free text alone, no branch, ambiguous wording), ask
once with `AskUserQuestion`, recommendation first. Never guess silently on this — it decides the
prefix, the folder, the branch, and the base for everything that follows.

**Ask only what you cannot resolve.** Missing information that changes the shape of the work (which
component, which behaviour on conflict, whether an existing interface changes or a new one appears)
→ ask with `AskUserQuestion`, one decision at a time, with a concrete recommendation first. Missing
detail you can settle as a careful colleague → settle it, and record it under *Decisions*.

**Never invent a requirement.** If the source does not say it, it is not in scope; if you think it
should be, propose it at the plan gate as an explicit addition — do not quietly build it.

---

## Phase 0.5 — Learn this project before planning anything

Everything technical comes from here. Read, in this order:

1. **The conventions file** — `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `.cursorrules`, whatever
   the repo carries. **It outranks this skill on every technical question.** Read it once, fully.
2. **The shape of the repo** — enough to place the change:

   ```bash
   ls
   git log --oneline -15
   git branch --show-current
   cat README.md 2>/dev/null | head -60
   ls docs/ 2>/dev/null
   ls docs/changes/ 2>/dev/null
   ```

3. **The stack and its gate** — from the manifest, not from a guess: `package.json` scripts,
   `Makefile` targets, `pyproject.toml`, `*.csproj`/`*.sln`, `Cargo.toml`, `go.mod`, the CI workflow
   in `.github/workflows/`. Note the exact build / test / lint / typecheck commands; you will run
   them in Phase 4 and cite them in the record.
4. **The existing records for this change type** — `ls docs/changes/<type>/` and read the newest one.
   It tells you the section structure, the language, the numbering and the index this project expects.
   If a sibling type has records but this one doesn't, use the sibling's structure as the closest
   precedent rather than inventing one from scratch.

**When the conventions file and the disk disagree** — it declares a layout, a folder or a tool that
is not there — **stop and report; do not pick a side.** Say which is which and let a person decide.
A conventions file that describes a project it no longer matches steers every later change wrong.

**Branch.** Every change type belongs on its own branch, per the table above (`feature/<slug>` from
`develop`, `bugfix/<slug>` from the `release/*` it targets, `hotfix/<slug>` from `main` — follow the
repo's own strategy and any issue-key pattern visible in `git log` if it differs). If you are on an
integration branch, or on a branch of the *wrong* type for this change, stop and say which branch is
needed — offer to create it, never create it unasked. Keep the branch slug equal to the record
folder's slug, so `git log` and `docs/changes/` speak the same language.

---

## Phase 1 — Investigation

Map the request onto the codebase before writing a line of the plan. Read the real files in every
area the change will touch.

### Investigation discipline (each of these has cost someone real time)

- **Check whether it already exists.** Grep for the route, the field, the function, the component,
  the job. A good share of "missing" functionality is present under another name, or was present and
  removed — check `git log -S<symbol>` and `git show` too.
- **Reuse before you add.** An existing helper, validator, shared type, wrapper or base class. A
  second parallel implementation of the same thing is a defect review rarely catches.
- **Read the code that already does the nearest thing** and follow it — its layering, its naming, its
  error handling, its test style. New code that reads like the code around it is the goal; a locally
  better pattern nobody else uses is a cost.
- **Read the project's own recorded lessons** when it keeps any — `docs/changes/fixes/`,
  `docs/rules/`, `docs/adr/`, previous `docs/changes/*/*/RESULT.md`. A change that contradicts a
  recorded decision must say so out loud, not silently.
- **Plan the whole family, not the instance.** A new field usually also belongs in the list response,
  the export, the validator, the mapper, the fixtures and the tests. Scope the siblings now;
  discovering them mid-implementation is what makes a plan mislead about cost.
- **Verify the premise still holds.** If the request is based on a report or an older analysis, check
  the current code before designing around it.
- **For a bugfix or hotfix specifically: reproduce it first.** Confirm the broken behaviour in the
  current code (a failing test, a repro script, a traced code path) before proposing a fix. A fix for
  a bug you haven't actually reproduced is a guess.

### Resolve the record identity

- **`<PREFIX><NNNN>`** — the next free number **for this change type**. If the project keeps an index
  (`docs/changes/<type>/README.md`), read it and take the next one; otherwise take the next after the
  highest existing folder under `docs/changes/<type>/`. Four digits, sequential, **never reused**, not
  even for an abandoned change. Feature, bugfix and hotfix numbering never share a counter.
- **`<slug>`** — 3–6 kebab-case words naming the change, matching the branch slug.
- If `docs/changes/<type>/` does not exist yet, create it and say so — this is record number one for
  that type. If `docs/changes/` itself doesn't exist yet either, create that too.

---

## Phase 2 — PLAN GATE: propose, wait, then write the README

**Mandatory for every change, feature, bugfix or hotfix alike.** A change always gets a plan, and the
plan always gets approved before any code — urgency shortens how long you spend on it, never whether
it happens.

**First, in chat — short enough to read on one screen:** the situation, what you intend to change and
where, what you deliberately will not touch, and every decision you need from the user. Use
`AskUserQuestion` for the decisions, one at a time, each with a recommendation and its trade-off.

**Wait for approval. Do not touch code while a question is open.**

Once approved, write `docs/changes/<type>/<PREFIX><NNNN>-<slug>/README.md` — the full spec behind the
summary that was just approved.

**Where the structure comes from**, in order of preference:

1. **The newest existing record of this type** in this project's `docs/changes/<type>/` — follow its
   structure exactly.
2. A template the project ships (`docs/templates/`, `.github/`), or one from an installed plugin:
   `ls -d ~/.claude/plugins/cache/*/*/*/docs/templates/ 2>/dev/null | sort -V | tail -1`
3. **The structure below**, when the project has neither.

| Section | Must contain |
| :--- | :--- |
| Metadata table | Type, branch (and base), state, scope in one line, how it will be verified |
| §1 Situation | What exists today; an **Evidence** list of real file paths, config values, log lines or source artefacts a reviewer can go and confirm; a numbered **Inventory** (A, B, C…) of the surfaces in scope; **Scale** as a number, not an adjective |
| §2 Intended outcome | The end state described as how it works, not as what the change is called; **Decisions** with the concrete value chosen; **Rejected alternatives** and why — the part that saves the next person's time |
| §3 Implementation | Numbered phases in execution order, each independently commitable and verifiable, naming the actual files |
| §4 Verification | The project's own commands and what counts as passing, with the pre-existing warning/failure baseline stated explicitly |
| §5 Risks | One per risk, with how you validate it did not happen. **An empty §5 means the plan is not ready.** |
| §6 Commit order | One row per reviewable unit, linked back to the §1 inventory |
| §7 Out of scope / handoff | What was decided **not** to do, and who it goes to |

Delete sections that genuinely do not apply — an empty section kept is noise. Adapt the section names
to whatever the project's existing records use.

> **Check for commit hooks before you write §3 and §6.** `ls .pre-commit-config.yaml .husky/
> .githooks/`, or `git config core.hooksPath`. When the repo formats or lints on commit, plan **as
> many small phases and commits as the work allows** — even within one coherent change, as long as
> each still builds and no two fight over the same lines. Hook cost scales superlinearly with the
> staged set (formatters run per batch, twice per batch when they find something), long runs get
> killed and leave orphaned compiler daemons, and pre-commit's stash/restore of whatever is left
> unstaged can roll back over untouched files and mangle shared solution or project files. A phase
> plan of "one commit for everything" is what makes those failures certain rather than possible.
>
> Put the **enabling change in its own first phase** — the dependency swap, the config or hook fix,
> the shared abstraction — then the code that consumes it, then the tests. `commit-push` carries the
> full mechanics; §6 just has to give it units small enough to work with.

> **The README is the spec as approved.** After implementation you do **not** rewrite it to match
> what happened. Deviations go in `RESULT.md`. A README edited after the fact stops being a plan and
> becomes a second, tidier RESULT.

---

## Phase 3 — Implementation

Implement **the phases of §3, in order**, so each one can be committed and verified on its own. Work
along the project's own dependency direction — schema/data first, then the layers that depend on it,
tests alongside.

The technical rules are the project's, from the conventions file read in Phase 0.5. What this skill
adds on top, and holds everywhere:

- **Write the minimum the change needs.** Touch only what §3 says you will touch. Adjacent work worth
  doing goes to §7 / RESULT, not into this change — this holds even harder for a hotfix, where the
  smallest diff that fixes the incident is the goal, not a broader cleanup.
- **Match the surrounding code** — its structure, naming, error handling, logging, comment density
  and test style.
- **Schema and data changes go through the project's migration mechanism**, never by hand-editing a
  committed migration and never by a tool the repo does not use. Keep any parallel model definition
  in sync in the same change. A migration that removes something purges every reference to it in the
  same change.
- **Never weaken a test to make it pass.** Add tests for the new behaviour in the project's existing
  style and location. For a bugfix or hotfix, the new test must **fail against the old code** and
  pass against the fix — that's what proves the bug is actually fixed, not just no-longer-triggered.
  If a test suite is intentionally failing (a red-by-design spec), leave it and say so.
- **No secrets, no credentials, no debug leftovers** committed. Nothing logged that should not be.
- **Remove what your own change made unused** — imports, variables, functions, dead branches.

If reality diverges from the plan — a phase turns out impossible, a defect blocks the path, the work
is bigger than scoped — **stop and say so** rather than improvising a different change. Small
divergences you resolve yourself get recorded in `RESULT.md` §3.

---

## Phase 4 — Verification

Run **the project's own gate**, the exact commands found in Phase 0.5 — build, then tests, plus lint
and typecheck when the repo has them. Never substitute a command the project does not use, and never
invent one.

- **State the baseline.** If the repo already had warnings or failing tests before your change, name
  them; a gate reported without its baseline cannot be read.
- **Run the whole suite, not a filter that matches nothing.** A filter that matches zero tests exits
  successfully and proves nothing — check the reported count is plausible.
- **A step that needs a running environment and could not be run is not a pass.** It goes to
  `RESULT.md` §4 *Not yet verified*, with what is needed to run it. This is the step that gets
  skipped; do not skip it.
- Never report green without having seen it. If it fails, fix the cause and re-run until it passes,
  or stop and report the blocker with the output.

---

## Phase 5 — RESULT.md

> **HARD STOP BEFORE THE FINAL RESPONSE.** The record is not optional. Delivering the implementation
> without `RESULT.md` is a failure of this skill, however long Phases 1–4 took, and however urgent the
> hotfix was.

Write `docs/changes/<type>/<PREFIX><NNNN>-<slug>/RESULT.md` — **added beside the README, which stays
exactly as approved.** Structure from the same source as the README (existing record of this type →
template → the table below).

| Section | Must contain |
| :--- | :--- |
| Metadata table | Type, branch, state (implemented / partially implemented — see §2), build **with baseline**, tests (and how many are new), coverage if gated, commits |
| §1 What was closed | Same A/B/C numbering as the README's inventory, so the two can be read side by side |
| §2 Points needing a decision | Each with its **operational consequence** — what the team will see happen until someone decides. "Later" is not a consequence |
| §3 Deviations from the approved plan | Where implementation diverged from the README, and why |
| §4 Not yet verified | What §4 of the README asked for and could not be run, with the reason. Never blank for convenience |
| §5 How to run the verification | The commands, and what each one proves |
| §6 Inventory of changes | Every path, marked new / changed / deleted, one line each — so a reviewer knows where to look first |

**Do not soften it.** A blocked step, partial work, a pre-existing gap found in passing — all of it
goes in, named. A `RESULT.md` that reads exactly like its `README.md` is almost always hiding
something.

### Then update what the project keeps

- **That change type's index**, if there is one (`docs/changes/<type>/README.md`): add the row for
  this change — id linking to `README.md` and `RESULT.md`, title, state, date, branch, and an *open
  items* column summarising §2 of the RESULT. Follow the table's existing columns and state
  vocabulary. Without this row the record is invisible.
- **The project's defect ledger**, if it keeps one (`docs/changes/fixes/` or equivalent) — only when
  the work also closed a **distinct pre-existing defect** along the way. One new file per defect, in
  that ledger's own format, cross-referencing this change's folder.
- **The conventions file** — only if the change modified a project-wide convention, and say so in the
  report.

---

## Phase 6 — Report

Short and factual:

- **Type and record folder** — feature/bugfix/hotfix, the path, and confirmation that both
  `README.md` and `RESULT.md` are in it.
- **What was built** — one line per §1 inventory item, closed or not.
- **Files changed** — the full list.
- **Gate** — the commands you ran and their real results, with the baseline.
- **Open items** — everything in RESULT §2 and §4, each with its consequence.
- **Index / ledger** — what you updated.
- **Next step** — the work is uncommitted: `commit-push` to commit (and push), then `create-pr` to
  open the PR. Do not run them from here.
