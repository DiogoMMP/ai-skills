# README style — voice and formatting

The README should read like a senior engineer briefing a new colleague: dense, specific, and always saying
*why*.

---

## Voice

**Write for the new joiner who will break something.** Every rule states the trap it prevents. Compare:

- ✗ "We use the factory pattern for entity creation."
- ✓ "**Factories** build entities; **update paths mutate** the loaded entity — calling the factory on an
  update would INSERT a new row."

**Assert, don't hedge.** State the rule and the consequence. No "generally", "should", "we try to". If
something is genuinely conditional, name the condition.

**Name real things.** Real class names, real folder paths, real policy names, real ports, real error codes.
A sentence with no proper noun in it is usually filler.

**Say why, once, briefly.** The most valuable half-sentences in a good README are the rationales — why a
lint rule is disabled, why jobs are invoked through DI instead of HTTP, why the schema is owned by the
migration tool and not the ORM. One clause is enough.

**No filler.** Never: "This project aims to…", "In this section we will…", "Feel free to…",
"Happy coding!", "As you can see". No emoji. No exclamation marks.

**Third person, present tense, active.** "The API serves…", "Repositories return the page and the total;
the service assembles the envelope." Use the imperative only for instructions to the reader
("Never force-push the protected branches").

**Density over length.** A prose lead of 1–3 lines, then a table or bullets. If a paragraph runs past four
lines, it is probably a table.

---

## Formatting

**Wrap prose at ~110 characters.** Never wrap inside a table row or a code fence.

**Horizontal rules.** `---` between every `##` section, and after the lead paragraph. Never between a `###`
and its parent.

**Headings.** One `#` (the title). `##` for sections, `###` for sub-sections, `####` for numbered setup
steps. Sentence case, not Title Case. `&` not `and` in headings.

**Bold** for terms being defined and for the choice column in tables. *Italics* for an optional/aside
qualifier (`| **<Tool>** | *Optional* | … |`). `Backticks` for every path, file, command, type, property,
env var, port, error code and package name — no exceptions.

**Tables.** Always left-aligned: `| :--- | :--- | :--- |`. Header words are singular nouns. Never leave a
cell empty in a table whose other rows are filled, except the last column where "no caveat" is a legitimate
value. Prefer a table to any list of pairs.

**Bullets.** `-` only. One rule per bullet. Lead with the bolded subject, then an em-dash, then the rule.
Sub-bullets one level deep at most.

**Numbered lists** only for genuinely ordered steps.

**Code fences.** Always tagged: `powershell`, `bash`, `json`, `sql`, `mermaid`, `csharp`, `ts`. The
*Solution layout* tree is the one deliberately untagged block. Put a `#` comment inside the fence when a
command needs a caveat — that is where readers actually look:

```bash
# Whole suite
<test command>

# Single module
<test command with filter>
```

**Blockquotes** for one thing only: a caveat or an external-doc pointer that must not be missed.

**Links.** Relative for anything in the repo, and the link text is the path in backticks:
[`docs/some-guide.md`](docs/some-guide.md). Absolute only for genuinely external documentation. Every link
verified against the filesystem.

**Numbers.** Pick one thousands style and keep it (thin space or plain digits) — do not mix. Versions
exactly as the manifest pins them.

**Em-dashes** (`—`) for the explanatory aside, which is this format's characteristic move. At most one per
sentence.

## Anti-patterns

| Don't | Do |
| :--- | :--- |
| "Uses an ORM for data access." | "**\<ORM\> \<version\>** + `\<driver\>` — ORM only; the schema is owned by \<migration tool\>." |
| "Run the tests." | A fenced block with the real commands and their inline comments. |
| "Configure your environment variables." | The complete settings / `.env` example, redacted. |
| "Standard GitFlow." | The branch table with the real ticket-key pattern, plus the rules for the protected branches. |
| A `## Jobs` section saying "N/A". | No `## Jobs` section at all. |
| "See the code for details." | The path to the code, and the one-line rule the code implements. |
| A badge for a tech absent from the tech-stack table. | Badges and table agree, version for version. |
| A `<SLOT>` or a `>>` guidance line from the template. | Every slot replaced with an evidenced fact, or the line deleted. |
